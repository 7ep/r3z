### r3z

This is an application by [Coveros](https://www.coveros.com/) to demonstrate good
software practices.  As we say in agile... _Working software over comprehensive 
documentation_ ... but that doesn't mean we can't have pretty good documentation too. 

#### Quick Start:

* Put Java on your PATH (see [JDK notes](#java-installation-notes))
* Clone or [download](https://github.com/7ep/r3z/archive/master.zip) this repo.  (if you download, unzip the file to a directory.)
* On the command line in the top directory of this repo, run `./gradlew run`
* Visit the application with your browser at http://localhost:8080
