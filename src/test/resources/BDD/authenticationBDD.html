<h3>Employee user story:</h3>

<userstory>
    As an employee, Andrea,
    I want to be able to securely use the system,
    so that I know my time entries are confidential and cannot be manipulated by others
</userstory>

<h3>Scenarios:</h3>

<h4>I cannot change someone else's time</h4>

<not-done>Given I am logged in as user alice and employees Sarah and Alice exist in the database,</not-done>
<not-done>when I try to add a time-entry for Sarah,</not-done>
<not-done>then the system disallows it.</not-done>

<h4>I should be able to register a user with a valid password</h4>

<not-done>Given I am not currently registered,</not-done>
<not-done>when I register a new user,</not-done>
<not-done>then the system records that the registration succeeded.</not-done>

<h4>I should not be able to register a user if they are already registered</h4>

<not-done>Given I have previously been registered,</not-done>
<not-done>when I try to register again,</not-done>
<not-done>then the system records that the registration failed.</not-done>

<h4>I should be able to log in once I'm a registered user</h4>

<not-done>Given I have registered,</not-done>
<not-done>when I enter valid credentials,</not-done>
<not-done>then the system knows who I am.</not-done>

<h4>if I enter a bad password while logging in, I will be denied access</h4>

<not-done>Given I have registered,</not-done>
<not-done>when I login with the wrong credentials,</not-done>
<not-done>then the system denies me access.</not-done>

<h4>if I enter an invalid password while registering, it will disallow it</h4>

<not-done>Given I am not registered,</not-done>
<not-done>when I register with too short of a password,</not-done>
<not-done>then the system denies the registration on the basis of a bad password.</not-done>
