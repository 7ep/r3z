    Adding the H2 database back in to check relative perf.

    New code for even-handed equivalent perf tests for the H2 database and the pure memory database.

    results
    =======

    2,920,000 time entries
    200 users
    4 entries a day
    for 3650 days
    800 * 3650 = 2,920,000 time entries

    Our pure memory database:

    INFO: It took 3 milliseconds to read all the users
    INFO: It took 7 milliseconds to create the projects
    INFO: It took 1 milliseconds to read all the projects

    INFO: It took 6691 milliseconds to enter all the time entries
    INFO: It took 164 milliseconds to get all the time entries for a user

    INFO: the time User(id=1, name=Aaren) spent was 1752000
    INFO: the time User(id=2, name=Aarika) spent was 1752000

    INFO: It took 29395 milliseconds to accumulate the minutes per user

    The H2 database:

    INFO: It took 4 milliseconds to read all the users (~2x longer)
    INFO: It took 369 milliseconds to create the projects (~30x longer)
    INFO: It took 14 milliseconds to read all the projects (~14 millis longer)

    INFO: It took 68554 milliseconds to enter all the time entries (~10x longer)
    INFO: It took 4500 milliseconds to get all the time entries for a user (~30x longer)

    INFO: the time User(id=1, name=Aaren) spent was 1752000
    INFO: the time User(id=2, name=Aarika) spent was 1752000

    INFO: It took 847246 milliseconds to accumulate the minutes per user (~30x longer)
