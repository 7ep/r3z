a totally non-secure, naive approach to getting the Let's Encrypt certs converted to a format
that will work just fine with our system.  Given what Let's Encrypt gives us (privkey.pem and fullchain.pem),
we convert it to a pkcs12 format and then import it to a keystore with keytool.

Note that we are hardcoding the password to "passphrase" here.  When we decide to get more serious,
would probably be a good idea to improve that a touch.

openssl pkcs12 -export -out r3z_fullchain_and_key.p12  -in fullchain.pem  -inkey privkey.pem  -name r3z

keytool -importkeystore -deststorepass passphrase -destkeypass passphrase -destkeystore keystore -srckeystore r3z_fullchain_and_key.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -srcstorepass passphrase -alias r3z
