The Lab
=======

The lab is an educational initiative at [Coveros](https://www.coveros.com/), 
focusing on agile engineering practices.  It is led by Byron Katz, an experienced
developer and agile expert.

When a new developer is starting out, they require strong guidance -
years of mentoring and refinement.  The best software practices are
found through many trials and tribulations, and several years can be
saved in a developer's education if guidance is provided.  Here is a
quote from a [forum] for experienced developers:

Unit testing is just one of many engineering practices learned
on-the-job.

To gain the knowledge for agile consulting, staff need explicit and
thorough training in proper practices while creating real software in
an agile team.  Without this training, we must rely on new staff to
already have it.  It is exceedingly unlikely that our staff will
accidentally become properly educated on best practices while
consulting.

These reasons are what gives purpose to The Lab.  We can create the
ideal environment to experience unusual practices that exist only in
agile.  Guided by an experienced teacher, we practice agile
engineering patterns in a highly disciplined way.

Practically speaking, it means we develop sophisticated software using
advanced practices like paired test-driven development.  We use a
modern programming language, Kotlin, which is excellent for multiple
programming paradigms (object-oriented, functional, etc.).  It makes
entire classes of bugs, like null-pointer exceptions, less possible.
Kotlin also has effortless access to the entire Java ecosystem, so any
library developed for Java over the last decades is easily included.

We also strive to incorporate the software design process into the
day-to-day development process.  In contrast, the commonplace industry
approach is to dedicate a role to software architecture.  We merge
this responsibility into the ordinary development process to empower
the team to seek innovation.

We embrace the learning and innovation that only happens when failure
is allowable.

By the way, there are different kinds of failure.  Small failures are
a necessity to success.  Big failures kill the project.  By avoiding
all failures, companies invite the catastrophic variety.

We embrace simplicity.  Systems that are built as simply as possible
from the ground up are far likelier to succeed.  Given the
implications of Gall's law, every new layer of functionality is added
as simply as possible into the working software.  Our product is a
success every step of the way:

>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from
>a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch
>never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to
>start over with a working simple system.
>
> -- John Gall

Experience attests to the validity of this statement.  One often hears
about the complexity of a system as a point of pride.  But admiring
complexity is an immaturity; complexity slows us down and causes bugs.
Practitioners must be ever vigilant for encroaching complexity to
chase it down and squash it.  Surprising as it may seem, simplicity is
much harder than complexity, but very worthwhile:

>“That depends on the length of the speech,” answered the President.

>it; if it is a half-hour speech it takes me a week; if I can talk as
>long as I want to it requires no preparation at all. I am ready now.”

and...

>Simple ain't easy.

We are also dedicated to creating a psychologically safe environment
where people feel safe to ask any question and suggest any course of
action.

That said, as with any group of people invested in an idea, there will
occasionally be conflict.  This environment will challenge us to
become better at managing disagreement and to be better leaders.

Handling disagreement properly in an agile team is a ripe area of
study.  Without a clear resolution policy, disagreements can kill
agile, even on a team of highly experienced practitioners.  Since we
want to simplify our educational prerogative, and because the group
follows practices that will often feel at odds with common sense, the
teacher is the authority in this initiative.

The only way to see the light at the end of the tunnel is to endure
the discomfort of spending sufficient time practicing non-intuitive
behaviors until the reason for them becomes apparent.

An interestingly apt metaphor for the agile approach is to consider it
a foreign language.  Many agile "experts" are really speaking
their original non-agile language with an agile accent.  Just how it
is easier to speak English with a French accent and insist we are
speaking French, it is easier to change titles and add new ceremonies
and insist we are following agile.

it is critically important to empower team members, however.  The
teacher must create an environment where, as much as feasible, the
participants are encouraged to show leadership and initiative.  By the
teacher monopolizing power on the team, all others are a "dev team
member", working as equals.  The team members conduct themselves with
high mutual respect, empowerment, and trust.  The students in the
group may not authoritatively state how the team must act.

In fact, the lab is not an agile environment.  It is an educational
deep-immersion laboratory that promotes many of the ideas behind agile
in a highly disciplined way.  This is to build a sufficient expertise
across the company so that agile becomes practicable in our consulting
approach.

A consulting company needs an internal project so employees can keep
their skills razor sharp.  In consulting, it is easy to become blunted
on the hard surface of our clients' cultures.  By the whetstone of an
internal project, we maintain an internal culture that aspires to a
higher level.

This will help our clients and company succeed outstandingly.
